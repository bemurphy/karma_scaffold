== Welcome to Hell

You don't want this repo.

I'm struggling to get the karma runner working with Rails.  It blows up with
coffeescript assets that have sprockets directives in them with the error
`Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL`.  It does not blow up on
directives in in-app assets, I don't think.

The s3-direct gem is included because it will cause the blow up.

Use `bundle exec rake test:karma:unit` to trigger a test run.
